The issue is likely theme-related. Your ThemeProvider is set to defaultTheme="system" which means it's detecting your system's theme preference. If your system is in dark mode, it's applying the dark theme colors, but your components might not be handling this correctly.
Let me help you debug this step by step:
Step 1: Force Light Theme First
In your layout file, temporarily change:
tsx<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light" enableSystem={false}>
This will force light theme and disable system detection to see if that fixes the issue.
Step 2: If that works, the problem is theme switching
Add this debug CSS to see what theme is actually being applied:
css@layer base {
  body::before {
    content: "Theme: " attr(class);
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: red;
    color: white;
    padding: 4px 8px;
    z-index: 9999;
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}
Step 3: Check Browser Developer Tools

Right-click on one of the black elements
Select "Inspect Element"
Look at the Computed tab in dev tools
Check what the actual background-color and color values are
Also check if the <html> or <body> element has a class="dark" attribute

Step 4: Component-Level Fix
If the theme switching is the issue, you can fix it by being more explicit in your component. Add this to your button and search elements:
tsx// Instead of just "bg-black", use:
className="bg-black dark:bg-white text-white dark:text-black"

// For the search inputs:
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-600"
Step 5: CSS Variable Debug
Add this temporary CSS to see what the actual color values are:
css@layer base {
  body::after {
    content: 
      "bg: " hsl(var(--background)) 
      " fg: " hsl(var(--foreground)) 
      " primary: " hsl(var(--primary));
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    background: orange;
    color: black;
    padding: 4px 8px;
    z-index: 9999;
    font-size: 10px;
    max-width: 300px;
    word-break: break-all;
  }
}
Try Step 1 first (forcing light theme) and let me know if that fixes the black elements issue. This will tell us if it's a theme detection problem or something else entirely.
