Based on the build error, I can diagnose the issue:
Primary Issue: Missing Sidebar Component
The build is failing because the CustomerLayout.tsx component is trying to import a Sidebar component that doesn't exist:
./components/layouts/CustomerLayout.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/Sidebar'
However, when I examined the actual CustomerLayout.tsx file in your repository, it doesn't contain any Sidebar imports. This suggests one of two scenarios:
Root Cause Analysis
Scenario 1: File Synchronization Issue
The local file I examined may be different from what's in your GitHub repository. The deployed version might contain:
tsximport { Sidebar } from '@/components/ui/Sidebar'  // This import doesn't exist
Scenario 2: Missing Shadcn/UI Sidebar Component
Your project may be using shadcn/ui components, and the Sidebar component was never properly installed or generated.
Diagnosis Steps

Check your actual GitHub repository at the exact commit 424994a to see if CustomerLayout.tsx contains a Sidebar import
Verify the components/ui directory - check if components/ui/sidebar.tsx exists
Check if other files import Sidebar - the error trace shows ./app/dashboard/page.tsx which might be importing CustomerLayout

Immediate Fix Options
Option 1: Remove Sidebar Import (if not needed)
If the CustomerLayout shouldn't use a Sidebar, remove the import:
tsx// Remove this line if it exists:
// import { Sidebar } from '@/components/ui/Sidebar'
Option 2: Install Missing Sidebar Component
If you need the Sidebar component, install it via shadcn/ui:
bashnpx shadcn@latest add sidebar
Option 3: Create Missing Component
If it's a custom component, create components/ui/sidebar.tsx or components/ui/Sidebar.tsx
Secondary Issues from Error Log
The build error is masking other issues mentioned in your error log:

TypeScript compilation errors
Database schema mismatches
React hydration errors
CSS theming issues

These will surface once the Sidebar import issue is resolved.
Recommended Action

Check your GitHub repository to see the actual content of CustomerLayout.tsx at commit 424994a
Fix the missing Sidebar import using one of the options above
Run the build again to reveal the next layer of issues
