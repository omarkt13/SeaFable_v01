// This component is now inlined in app/dashboard/page.tsx for simplicity.
// If it grows too large, it can be extracted back into its own file.
```

becomes

```typescript
// This component is now inlined in app/dashboard/page.tsx for simplicity.
// If it grows too large, it can be extracted back into its own file.
```

```typescript
export function WishlistTab({ dashboardData }: WishlistTabProps) {
  const wishlist = mockUserData.wishlist
```

becomes

```typescript
export function WishlistTab({ dashboardData }: WishlistTabProps) {
  // For now, wishlist will be empty since it's not implemented in the database yet
  const wishlist: any[] = []
```

Here is the final code:

```typescript
// This component is now inlined in app/dashboard/page.tsx for simplicity.
// If it grows too large, it can be extracted back into its own file.
